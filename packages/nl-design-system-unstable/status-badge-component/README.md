# Status badge

## UX Guidelines

A status badge draws attention and alerts a user to system states. The information in a status badge is short, concise and clearly scannable.

### Variants

- Success
- Warning
- Error

### Alternatives and related components

- Status light
- Text badge

### Anatomy

- Container with padding
- Status text

### Design properties

#### Positioning and placement

Only a single status badge can be shown per state. The status badge should be placed there where the context makes sense. For a system-wide status this would mean that the status should be shown on a high level in the UI.

#### Typography

A status may be set in all-caps.

#### Color

The variants share their color semantics with the colors for success, warning, and error feedback.

### Accessibility

- Make sure there is enough contrast between the fore- and background colors.
- The text of the status badge should be self-explanatory thus eliminating the need for additional texture or iconography to indicate variations in status for colorblind users.
- Status text and subsequent changes to the status–should they occur–should be announced by screen reading software in a way that it makes sense in context.

### Content guidelines

### Best practices

#### Do

#### Don't

- To avoid confusion with buttons it is advisable to not mimic the shape and overall appearance of a button.
- Avoid using status badges in running text.
