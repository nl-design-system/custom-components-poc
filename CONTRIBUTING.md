# Contributing

## Code of Conduct

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. Read [our Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) if you haven't already.

## TL;DR

Before you make a commit or PR, install our code check tools using `npm ci` and then `npm run bootstrap`. Run `npm run lint` and `npm run test` to see if everything is in order. Many things can be fixed automatically using `npm run lint-fix`. Make separate commits for separate purposes. Prefix all your commit message with `fix:`, `feat:`, `docs:` or any of [the other allowed commit types](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#type). When you make a PR you will need to sign our [Contributor License Agreement](CLA.md), so first check with your employer if you need to.

## Processes

This projects uses the following processes:

- [Required code reviews](https://github.com/features/code-review/): every PR needs to be approved by (other) maintainers before it can be merged.
- Required code checks: code must match our defined code style, tests and builds need to succeed before a PR can be merged.
- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): commits messages should follow the [specified pattern](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#type), so we can have nice things such as automatic semantic versioning and automatically generating change logs based on the commit history.
- [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org)

## Code Style

The project uses the following tools to automate checking and fixing code style rules:

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org) ([rules](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/))
- [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org)
- [HTML-validate](https://html-validate.org) ([rules](https://html-validate.org/rules/index.html))
- [npm-package-json-lint](https://npmpackagejsonlint.org/) ([rules](https://npmpackagejsonlint.org/docs/en/rules))
- [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) ([rules](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint#rules--aliases))
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
- [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) ([rules](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/rules/list))

Check of there are plugins available for your code editor of choice, to enable these tools during development. That way you won't find yourself alerted by Husky and lint-staged to fix formatting issues, just when you are about to commit your code.

For automating checks:

- [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky): automatically install Git hooks
- [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) - quickly run code style checks for only the files that are staged in Git

### CSS

CSS is formatted using stylelint. The stylelint configuration is stored in the npm package `@wesaynih.dev/stylelint-config`.

### JavaScript and TypeScript

ESLint is used for JavaScript checks. The ESLint configuration is stored in the npm package `@wesaynih.dev/eslint-config`.

### JSON

JSON is formatted using Prettier.

**Use the `.json` file extension where possible**: configuration files such as `.eslintrc.json` have an explicit file extension and is not called simply `.eslintrc` to ensure all code formatting rules can be applied automatically.

**Avoid code formatting in generated JSON files**: files generated by tools, such as `package.json` that regularly updated using `npm install`, should be excempt from automatic formatting. Configure these files in `.prettierignore`.

## Contributing as a designer or content specialist

The NL Design System encourages contributions from designers, copywriters and other stakeholders. There are many different ways to make a useful contribution, from the addition of (UX) documentation, new design components to fixing typing errors.

In order to contribute you must have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).

### Using GitHub

GitHub allows the NL Design System to be maintained in the open. Hosting the content on GitHub has several benefits; all the content is freely available to everything in a central place and can accept contributions from everyone. Version control means that a full history is kept of the progress of and changes to the project. Changes can be reverted when needed.

The easiest way to work with GitHub is through the [GitHub Desktop application](https://desktop.github.com/), available for both macOS and Windows.

For both new additions and changes to existing components or documentation you first need to create a ‘branch’. A branch duplicates the ‘repository’ (all content of the project), and allows you to make changes or additions safely in isolation without impacting the rest of the project.

Once your work is finished you are able to ‘commit’ your changes first to your branch. It is important to describe as clear and concise as possible what you have changed or added in the commit message. This message will be displayed to reviewers and all other contributors of the project. A longer in-depth description message can be provided as well should it be needed.

The project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) in order for commit messages to follow a consistent pattern.

Commit messages must always start with a type, for example ‘docs:’ for changes to additions to documentation. Other relevant types are ‘feat:’ for new features and ‘fix:’ for bug fixes to components. A [full overview of types is available here](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#type).

#### Example commit message

```text
docs: accessibility improvements to status badge
^--^  ^----------------------------------------^
|     |
|     +-> Consise, short summary
|
+-------> Type
```

After committing your changes to your branch you need to merge them to the main repository by clicking on the ‘Publish branch’ button. You have to make an additional ‘pull request’ to let reviewers know about your changes.

Before an addition or change is approved and added to the NL Design System it will first go through a review phase. If changes are needed, you will automatically receive an email on the address associated with your GitHub account.

### Writing documentation

Documentation is written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), an easy to write and read text format that can easily be converted to other formats. Markdown allows documents to be consistently formatted and structured.

GitHub uses its own ‘flavor’ of Markdown. [See this list for an overview of all the formatting options](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) allowed in documentation.

When referencing tokens they should be written between ‘backticks’ (`` ` ``). This ensures tokens will be rendered as code.

### Design components

Documentation supports Figma-based components to be included. Details on process and workflow for this to follow.
